## What does it do

- Storage handling with localStorage / sessionStorage with cookie fallback.
- localStorage / sessionStorage supported check.

## Install

Import module

```javascript
// Import all exports
import * as Storage from '@/utilities/storage'

// Import specific module
import { LocalStorage } from '@/utilities/storage'
import { SessionStorage } from '@/utilities/storage'
import { localStorageIsSupported } from '@/utilities/storage'
import { sessionStorageIsSupported } from '@/utilities/storage'
```

## How to use

### Detection

```javascript
// Detect localStorage
import { localStorageIsSupported } from '@/utilities/storage'

// Detect sessionStorage
import { sessionStorageIsSupported } from '@/utilities/storage'
```

### Storage types

You can use either localStorage or sessionStorage

```javascript
// Use localStorage
import { LocalStorage } from '@/utilities/storage'

// Use sessionStorage
import { SessionStorage } from '@/utilities/storage'

// Use both
import { LocalStorage, SessionStorage } from '@/utilities/storage'
```

### Set prefix

It can be handy to prefix your storage objects for easier backtracing later on. This is completely optional.

```javascript
LocalStorage.setPrefix('projectX')
```

### Set data

You can set any kind of data

```javascript
LocalStorage.set('data', { foo: 'bar' })
```

### Get data

```javascript
LocalStorage.get('data')
```
