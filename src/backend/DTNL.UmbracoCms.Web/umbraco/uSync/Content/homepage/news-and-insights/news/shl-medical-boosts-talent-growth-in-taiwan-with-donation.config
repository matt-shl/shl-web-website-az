This initiative reinforces SHL Medical’s long-standing commitment to empowering the next generation of innovators and strengthening academic collaboration.  </p>\n<p>The Electropuls E10000 enables both static and dynamic testing of materials, such as plastics and metals, and other components, featuring oil-free linear and rotary motor technology for clean operation and high dynamic performance. This donation offers students hands-on experience using advanced material testing technology, boosting their practical skills and research capabilities. In addition, SHL Medical will support the implementation process, and offer technical support and training to ensure students are fully equipped to operate this industry-grade equipment.   </p>\n<p>“This donation marks a significant milestone in our efforts to equip students with the tools and skills they need to thrive in the fast-evolving medtech landscape,” said Peter Heuberger, SHL Medical’s Global Head of Testing and Simulation. “By providing access to this testing machine, we aim to inspire students and elevate their learning experience.” </p>\n<p>Professor Yi-Feng Lin, the Dean of Engineering College at CYCU, expressed his gratitude, “We deeply appreciate SHL Medical’s generous donation. It not only enriches our educational resources but also prepares students for their future careers.” </p>\n<p>SHL Medical has been collaborating with CYCU since early this year as a broader initiative to bridge the gap between academia and industry. This partnership includes an internship program aimed at cultivating the next generation of talents, offering valuable opportunities to students from CYCU and other universities across Taiwan.  </p>\n<p>The program exposes students to various facets of autoinjector developments, providing invaluable hands-on experience and practical training. Aligned with SHL Medical’s dedication to driving innovation through diverse perspectives, the program engages both local and international students. Participants work within the company’s manufacturing and development facilities, gaining essential skills and knowledge for successful careers in the medtech industry.  </p>\n<p>“As a global company with deep roots in Taiwan, we are committed to investing in various talent development initiatives that empower students to excel,” said Sebastian Feng, General Manager of SHL Medical Taiwan. “By partnering with academic institutions, we cultivate a diverse talent pipeline that embodies our commitment to innovation and excellence.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>An integral part of this talent development initiative includes organizing on-site visits to SHL Medical’s state-of-the-art facilities in Taiwan. These tours offer students firsthand insights into the complexities of autoinjector manufacturing. During these visits, students have the opportunity to engage directly with industry professionals and observe innovative processes, deepening their understanding of how SHL Medical’s work contributes to enhancing patient care.   </p>\n<p>SHL Medical’s talent development initiative is fully aligned with its strategic goals of innovation and corporate social responsibility. Through this program, the company fosters a culture of creativity, diversity, and collaboration, ensuring that future leaders in medical technology are well-prepared to enable patients’ independence.  </p>\n",
