This acquisition marks a significant milestone in our journey towards globalizing our operations to better serve our customer base. We are happy to welcome Superior Tooling into the SHL family.”</p>\n<p><strong>Expanding tooling capabilities globally</strong></p>\n<p>The acquisition of Superior Tooling not only supports the tooling needs of SHL’s in-house manufacturing but also its strategy to deliver the highest quality tools to customers across industries. The US company will work closely with SHL’s existing tooling departments to develop new solutions for its global customer base.</p>\n<p>“This marks a significant step forward for our potential and growth trajectory. We take great pride in having our capabilities recognized by a global player, and eagerly look forward to maximizing them as integral members of SHL Medical.
