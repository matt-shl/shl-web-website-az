        "markup": "\n<p></p>\n<p>This October, SHL Group will participate in the Parenteral Drug Association's largest conference of this year, the Universe of Pre-Filled Syringes and Injection Devices.</p>\n<p>SHL will proudly showcase a range of innovative technologies and state-of-the-art designs that deliver high-quality products with an intuitive, user-friendly experience. Among the top displays this year is SHL's unique Needle Isolation Technology (NIT®), a market-proven mechanism applied in autoinjectors that carry cartridges with pre-installed needles to prevent contamination and enhance user safety. Another highlight will be the Rotaject®, a patented clock spring technology for the constant force delivery of high volume and high viscosity drug formulations of up to several hundred centipoise. Demonstrations on these high-tech and user-friendly devices will be held throughout the exhibition.</p>\n<p>SHL's pioneering autoinjector, Molly® will also be on display this year. Since its launch, Molly® has redefined the standards of production timelines with its preconfigured designs and stood the test of time with its ultra-compact design and inherent flexibility. Visitors are welcome to stop by our booth and learn how Molly® can solve the commercialization challenges presented by increased competition in the race to market. Representatives will also answer questions on the company's comprehensive capabilities and vertically integrated final assembly, labeling, and packaging services that reduce timelines to clinic, to market, and to the patients in need.</p>\n<p>With the 2018 PDA exhibit's theme being \"Transforming Pre-Filled Systems through Innovation,\" the company is set on showcasing its ability to innovate and adapt through its connective products. Understanding the importance of innovation as a drive for success, SHL offers a full range of connected drug delivery solutions for next-generation healthcare, supported by years of deep knowledge in the industry and active partnerships in connected therapeutics. Managing director of SHL Connect, Markus Bauss will also co-present a talk on smart packaging at the main event on October 8, titled \"Using Smart Packaging to Enhance Supply Chain Quality of Drug Delivery Devices – How Smart Primary Packaging and Object Aware Machinery Can Lead to Better Quality Outcomes.\"</p>\n<p>\"We are in an era where smart technology and digitization is seamlessly woven into a person's life, which inevitably will also include their healthcare. Patients are seeking more customized services and pharma companies are intent on providing them. We are ready to offer our best solutions for pharma companies at the Orlando event this year,\" said Magnus Fastmarken, global marketing director at SHL Group.</p>\n<p>The two-day exhibition will be held between October 8-9 at the Loews Royal Pacific in Orlando, Florida. Visit SHL at Booth 419-420 to find out more about how its drug delivery devices and comprehensive solutions can help bring your innovative drug formulation to life.</p>\n",
