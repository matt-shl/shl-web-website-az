        "markup": "<p>SHL Medical has joined the NSTC Science Train Program for the second consecutive year as part of its human-centered sustainability approach. In partnership with the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), SHL thrives to promote the development of science education in Taiwan through diversified scientific activities. The SHL-designated train car will make stops at 34 stations in 18 counties and cities across Taiwan. During train rides, students from 173 elementary schools will participate in physics experiments that center on precision healthcare related topics that were jointly designed by SHL and teachers and students of the Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University and Taoyuan Senior High School. The experiments aim to inspire elementary schoolers’ curiosity towards science as well as raising the public’s awareness of science knowledge.</p>\n<p>Sebastian Feng, General Manager of SHL Medical Taiwan, said: “SHL Medical is very delighted to support the development of science education in Taiwan for the second consecutive year. We strongly believe that patient-centric innovations support the enhancement of social wellness. We have endeavored to make drug delivery systems easier to handle with increased convenience, which is very important for patients who struggle with their diseases. This year, we want to present the theory behind SHL products through lively and interesting scientific experiments. Using conveniently available and recyclable materials, we want to illustrate the importance of digital healthcare, precision drug delivery, and sustainable development, hence inspiring the curiosity of elementary schoolers and encourage their development of various skills in multiple areas.”</p>\n<p>SHL Medical strongly supports the Science Train Program launched by the NTSC. For the second consecutive year, SHL invited teachers and students from the Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University and Taoyuan Senior High School to propose new ideas, while adding more interesting elements to the experiment. This year’s experiments encourage students to use recyclable materials to raise awareness around sustainability while promoting the concept of precision healthcare. SHL aims to inspire next-generation scientists among elementary schoolers with interesting scientific experiments.</p>",
