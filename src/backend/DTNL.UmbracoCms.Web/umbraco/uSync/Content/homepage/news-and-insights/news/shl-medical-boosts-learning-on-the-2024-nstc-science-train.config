In collaboration with the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), SHL reaffirms its commitment to advancing science education in Taiwan through interactive scientific activities designed to inspire the next generation of innovators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Scheduled between October 21-26, the Science Train—featuring a designated SHL Medical carriage focused on precision healthcare—will traverse 27 stations across 16 counties and cities in Taiwan. Throughout the ride, students from 30 elementary schools will engage in a series of physics experiments that are designed by teachers and students from Taoyuan Senior High School, Dayuan Senior High School, Pingtung Senior High School, and Tamkang Senior High School. These experiments aim to ignite students' interests toward science while promoting public awareness on scientific knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_38134\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1200\"] <span data-teams=\"true\"><span class=\"ui-provider a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Sebastian Feng, General Manager of SHL Medical Taiwan, (fifth from the left), participated in a group photo with representatives from corporate sponsors of the NSTC Science Train, guests, and elementary school students at the opening press conference, celebrating the launch of the Science Train's island-wide tour.</span></span></span>[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Sebastian Feng, General Manager of SHL Medical Taiwan, remarked: “At SHL Medical, we are committed to supporting initiatives like the NSTC Science Train Program that inspire young minds to explore the wonders of science. As the pioneering leader in self-injection solutions, SHL Medical values the opportunity to share our expertise. This year, we extend our sincere appreciation to Professor Wei-Chin Hung from the R.O.C. Military Academy for designing a series of engaging science experiments to help students understand key concepts such as pressure, friction, as well as the principles behind precise drug delivery. This further emphasizes SHL’s role in nurturing educational initiatives that spark future innovations in advanced drug delivery systems.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This initiative not only enhances the educational experience for students but also highlights SHL’s role in elevating the young minds and nurturing scientific advancement. The Science Train closing ceremony will be held at Nangang Station, Taipei, on October 26, marking the culmination of a week-long journey of discovery and inspiration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_38136\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1200\"] <span data-teams=\"true\"><span class=\"ui-provider a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak\" dir=\"ltr\">Sebastian Feng, General Manager of SHL Medical Taiwan joined a group photo in front of SHL Medical carriage with teachers and students from Dayuan Senior High School and Fude Elementary School on the first day of the Science Train event.</span></span>[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The Science Train is just one of the several initiatives SHL launched to strengthen its role in promoting greater education and community engagement in Taiwan. In early August this year, 71 teachers and students from participating high schools visited SHL’s Taoyuan-Liufu site. Throughout the visit, the group was given an exclusive tour of the company’s production lines and laboratories, where they gained insight into the practical application of scientific principles in advanced medical manufacturing. SHL employees also shared their career experiences and helped students enhance their understanding of experimental principles and presentation skills.    </p>\n<p>Beyond the Science Train, SHL has collaborated with various schools and institutions in Taiwan to educate and cultivate a young generation of talented and skilled minds. One of the collaborations led to the introduction of SHL-led apprenticeship program that provides local students with hands-on experience in manufacturing operations, including tooling and molding, all under the guidance of seasoned SHL supervisors. This endeavor is further exemplified through the donation of second-hand laptops and monitors to elementary schools in Taoyuan, reinforcing SHL’s commitment to supporting education and community engagement.   </p>\n<p>SHL Medical looks forward to inspiring future innovators and supporting advancements in the MedTech industry through meaningful collaborations and sustainable initiatives.  </p>\n",
