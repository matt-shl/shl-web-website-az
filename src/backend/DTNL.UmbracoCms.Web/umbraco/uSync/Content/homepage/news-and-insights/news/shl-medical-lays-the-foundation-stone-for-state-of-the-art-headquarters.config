        "markup": "\n\n\n\n\n<p>SHL Medical, in collaboration with Tech Cluster Zug and esteemed partners, on May 23, 2024, proudly marked a significant milestone with the cornerstone ceremony for its forthcoming flagship headquarters, the \"SHL-Südtor\" project. The new headquarters will span 21,000 square meters, seamlessly integrating office spaces with cutting-edge manufacturing facilities. Anticipated to accommodate nearly 350 employees and expected to have an annual output of around 80 million autoinjector units, it will underscore SHL Medical's commitment to innovation and excellence.</p>\n<p>Announced in 2021, the project plan for the new site has been further developed by Penzel Valier AG since then. After months of meticulous planning, groundwork commenced in February 2023, allowing constructions to begin in April 2024. The timeline is set for a grand inauguration slated for 2026.</p>\n<p>The foundation stone laid marks a milestone for SHL Medical and the city of Zug by bringing a modern building to the city. Expanding its manufacturing capacity, enables SHL to also expresses a commitment to the local community by creating additional jobs, as well as supporting existing talents with a new space to further develop.</p>\n<p>Ulrich Faessler, Chairman and CEO of SHL Medical, shared his vision for the project, stating, “With our fully automated, highly efficient production facility, we will prove that Zug is an ideal location for our production bringing highly innovative and therefore highly complex and high-quality products to our European customers.  At the same time, I firmly believe that our new headquarters will be an expression of our core competence and great strength – manufacturing and providing products that meet our customers' requirements.”</p>\n<p>In his inaugural speech, Zug’s mayor André Wicki expressed his excitement about Zug further expanding as an industrial location with SHL laying the steppingstone. During the ceremony a symbolic time capsule, containing building and architecture plans, a daily newspaper and SHL devices, was embedded in the foundation of the new building.</p>\n<p>This venture represents more than a standalone project; it is a pivotal component of SHL Medical's global expansion strategy. SHL Medical is about to open a production site in North Charleston, US underscoring its commitment to international growth. Notably, SHL Medical has also solidified its presence through strategic acquisitions in Switzerland and the USA over the past year, fortifying its global production capabilities.</p>\n<p>While architecture of the new site provides an environment that optimally supports the activities of employees and the operations, the building itself stands as a testament to SHL Medical's dedication to sustainability. Aligned with Tech Clusters Zug’s vision to build a smart and ecological technology hub, it boasts forward-looking construction concept and sustainable energy supply based on cooling with lake water and the introduction of waste heat into the site-wide district heating system, the building also sends out a clear signal for the industrial future of Switzerland.</p>\n",
