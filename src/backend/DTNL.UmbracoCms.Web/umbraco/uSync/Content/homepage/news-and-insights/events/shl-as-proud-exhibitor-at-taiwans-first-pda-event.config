        "markup": "\n<p></p>\n<p>SHL Group is proud to announce its participation in an inaugural edition of a new conference launched in Taiwan by the Parenteral Drug Association (PDA) – the 2018 PDA Drug Delivery of Injectables Conference. The event will be held from November 6-7 at the Regent Hotel in Taipei, themed “From Primary Containers to Devices.”</p>\n<p>The conference marks a first in Taiwan and will kick off with updates on recent regulatory changes on parenteral packaging, followed by a series of sessions on primary packaging components, devices, and fill-finish procedures. As a global leader in the design, development, and manufacturing of advanced drug delivery devices such as autoinjectors and pen injectors, SHL Group will host several talks as well as sit in as a panelist during the closing panel discussion. Notable speakers from the company will share their expertise on numerous topics ranging from automated assembly and testing processes to connected solutions.</p>\n<p>SHL Group will showcase its innovative devices and technologies covering different customer and patient needs in the area of autoinjectors. SHL will also present its range of next-generation connected solutions for drug delivery systems.</p>\n<p>Founded by Swedish entrepreneur Roger Samuelsson, SHL Group began its legacy in Taiwan starting from the early 90s. Based upon its deep Taiwanese roots, the company then flourished into a global enterprise of more than 4,000 employees.</p>\n<p>Global Marketing Director and also co-chair of this conference, Magnus Fastmarken remarked: “We are confident this conference will open up many unprecedented opportunities for attending pharma companies, suppliers, and even the Taiwanese government. SHL started out as a small manufacturing base located in Taiwan. It has since evolved into a strong, vibrant international corporation that now provides a full range of integrated services. We believe that Taiwan is the optimal venue for an Asian PDA conference with its strategic location close to China, South Korea, and Japan. There is a big interest in bringing knowledge to Asian companies launching in Europe and the US as well as companies launching drugs in advanced drug delivery devices in the fast-moving Asian markets.”</p>\n<p>The two-day event will be held in Taipei, followed subsequently by two days of workshop sessions. SHL Connect Managing Director Markus Bauss and SHL Director of Technology in Engineering Solutions Ramin Rafiei will each deliver professional talks at the upcoming workshop sessions.</p>\n",
