SHL Medical Taiwan also won the “Gender Equality” award. The Excellent Enterprise Award in Taoyuan City by Taoyuan City Government aimed to reward companies located in Taoyuan for their contributions to the regional economic environment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senior Director Human Resources Lillian Yao commented: “SHL Medical continuously develops its business under the core vision of Enabling Patients’ Independence, and strives to combine its developments under our sustainability strategy: People, Product and Planet. SHL Medical set foot in Taoyuan more than 30 years ago and has continuously cultivated local talents, particularly through the promotion of our Swiss Apprenticeship program. We also recruit highly skilled talents to drive corporate digital transformation and smart manufacturing under global trends. In terms of talent retention and welfare, SHL Medical Taiwan offers educational and wellness programs that ensure a friendly, healthy, diverse, and open-minded working environment.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>SHL Medical Taiwan introduced a Swiss Apprenticeship a decade ago in Taiwan to cultivate local talents through hands-on experience. To truly practice work-life balance, SHL Medical implemented flexible working hours. We launched a global remote work and home office policy, enabling colleagues to choose the working location and time. From the health and well-being perspective, SHL Medical Taiwan offers annual health examinations and provides cancer and bone density examinations. Moreover, the company has initiated several health and fitness programs to encourage colleagues in maintaining workout habits after work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Massage rooms are implemented at all SHL Medical sites in Taiwan for colleagues to relief stress during work time. In addition, SHL Medical Taiwan actively promotes our maternity health program that offers a family-friendly parental leave policy to ensure that our colleagues can start families under good care. In terms of talent development, SHL Medical Taiwan grants annual Chinese and English learning programs, on-job training scholarships, and on-job training to encourage our colleagues to advance their professional skills.</p>\n<p>During the pandemic, SHL Medical also implemented COVID related prevention policies. It complied with the water-saving program from the government to demonstrate our efforts of giving back to the local community. This award symbolizes SHL Medical’s dedication in taking care of our colleagues, contributing to the local community, and embracing cultural diversity.</p>\n",
