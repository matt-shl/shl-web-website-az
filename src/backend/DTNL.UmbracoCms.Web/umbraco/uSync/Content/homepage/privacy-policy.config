We understand that our success in achieving this goal will be partially based on how we protect your privacy and safeguard your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we will achieve this goal while providing you with an optimal online user experience.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Applicability</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>This Privacy Policy applies to personal information (as defined by applicable law) collected by SHL through the website,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.shl-medical.com/\">www.shl-medical.com</a><span>&nbsp;and any other websites, apps, platforms, and other online portals, products, and services that we presently offer or will offer in the future (“SHL Services”). This Privacy Policy applies to you who visit our website or otherwise make use of SHL Services. Please take the time to read this Privacy Policy carefully before providing us with personal information or using SHL Services.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Information we may collect</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>We collect personal information provided directly by you as well as personal information and other information about your use of the SHL Services.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Registering.</strong><span>&nbsp;Should you wish to contact SHL and register to receive information or apply for employment then we collect information voluntarily provided by you that includes your name, e-mail address, language preference, and the purpose (“Account Information”). We may also collect your IP address, MAC address, geographic location, log files, browser, information about your device, and other information (“Data Log”).</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Just visiting.</strong><span>&nbsp;If you visit our website or make use of our SHL Services, then a Data Log and related information will be collected on your visit or use.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Sensitive personal information.</strong><span>&nbsp;We do not ask users to submit information that could be sensitive personal information under applicable law. If you choose to submit sensitive personal information through your use of the SHL Services, you acknowledge that the submission is voluntary, as would be any subsequent processing and use as a result of the collection.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Legal.</strong><span>&nbsp;We collect personal information as and if required or permitted by law.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Consent.</strong><span>&nbsp;We may collect additional personal information where we have obtained your consent. In all such cases, an option for you to provide your consent will be given.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>We may use cookies and similar technology to allow us to optimize your use of the SHL Services. If you are unfamiliar with cookies then let’s take a minute to explain cookies and our cookie policy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Cookies.</strong><span>&nbsp;Cookies are small text files or pieces of information that are stored on the browser of your computer or other device. Cookies make it easier for us to provide the SHL Services by allowing us to identify your device. Cookies may also allow us to better understand how you use SHL Services and allow us to better tailor our services to your interests and needs. Some cookies may contain personal information or could become personal information when other information is incorporated.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Types.</strong><span>&nbsp;We use two types of cookies: session and persistent. Session cookies are created temporarily in your browser’s subfolder while you are visiting a website. Session cookies will be deleted once you leave a website. Persistent cookie files remain valid in your browser’s subfolder unless manually deleted by you or until the cookie’s expiry date. There is an expiry date being written into the code of all persistent cookies. The duration can vary but should not last longer than twelve months per the ePrivacy Directive. In practice, the persistent cookies could remain on your hard drive much longer if no action is taken.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>How we use cookies.</strong><span>&nbsp;The cookies that we may use fall into the following categories:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Third-Party Cookies</span><span>. These cookies are placed on your device, not by the website you are visiting, but by a third party like an advertiser or an analytic system. We use Google Analytics to analyze the use of our website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about use of our website such as number of new visitors to our website, how long visitors spend browsing our website and which pages they viewed by means of cookies which are stored on your device. For more details regarding Google Analytics, kindly refer to:&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html\">https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</a>.</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Strictly Necessary Cookies.</span><span>&nbsp;These types of cookies enable you to use our website and its features. Disabling these cookies can affect how our website performs and may prevent you from making use of all its services and features.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Functionality Cookies.</span><span>&nbsp;Functionality cookies are also known as “preferences cookies”. These cookies allow a website to remember choices you have made (such as your user name, text size, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. We use these cookies for you to download documents from our website easily.</span></li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Analytical and Performance Cookies.</span><span>&nbsp;Analytical and performance cookies collect information about how you use a website, like which pages you visited and which links you clicked on. None of this information can be used to identify you. It is all aggregated and, therefore, anonymized. Their sole purpose is to improve website functions. This includes cookies from third-party analytics services as long as the cookies are for the exclusive use of the owner of the website visited. We place Google Analytics on our website<strong>.</strong></span></li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Security Cookies.</span><span>&nbsp;These cookies support additional security features on the website.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Your options.</strong><span>&nbsp;If you do not want to receive cookies then you are free to adjust the settings in your browser. We cannot guarantee though that the website and all its services will operate properly or that you will be provided with the optimal SHL experience.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Where our website contains links to other websites, this cookie policy will not apply to those third-party websites. When you link through to another website you should read the privacy policy which applies to that website.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Processing and use of your personal information</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>We process and use your personal information to offer the SHL Services as well as for the express purposes set out below.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Services.</strong><span>&nbsp;We process and use your personal information to provide you with the SHL Services as well as to allow us to improve the provision of those services to you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Customization.&nbsp;</strong><span>We process and use your personal information to allow for your SHL experience to be optimal by, at times, customizing information, content, and communications being requested by and provided to you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Communications.</strong><span>&nbsp;We process and use your personal information to allow you to communicate with SHL.
